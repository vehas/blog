# test case for jsonPath
all of the test case come from [jsonpath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)

### this is test bench for learning new programming language or tool that should be able to solve this problem

### list all of jsonPath implementation are in
/bis/json_path__*
### currently only have
1. clojure

### plan to have 
1.  c  (start use in school)
2.  c++20 (start use in school)
3.  visual basic (start use in school)
4.  javascript (start use in school)
5.  java (start use in Uni)
6.  prolog (start use in Uni)
7.  PHP (start use at side project when in Uni)
8.  python (start use in Uni)
9.  C# (start at work)
10. haskell (learn concept of category theory)
11. go (seem cool to know)
12. rust (seem cool to know)
13. web assemble (assemble)
14. pytorch (machine learning)
15. lean (theorem prover)
16. Janus (time-reversible computing programming language)
17. enso (dual syntaxes between text and visual language)
18. solidity (smart contract on ethereum)
19. Plutus (smart contract on cardano)
20. kotlin (mobile)
21. dart (mobile)
22. swift (mobile)
23. scala 3.0 (mixed language)
24. small talk (for the love of alen key)
25. verilog (hardware description language)
26. webGL (GPU programming)
27. erlang (for VM)
28. ruby   (start use at work)

### what should have in each language
1. code
2. test

### what should have in each language
1. CI with docker & github action
2. instruction to run code
3. performance testing 
4. generative testing
